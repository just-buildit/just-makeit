# standard.mk — the shared Makefile for just-buildit and doppler-dsp repos.
#
# Canonical copy:  https://just-buildit.github.io/standard.mk
# Design RFC:      doppler-dsp/doppler#555
# Plan + criteria: just-buildit/.github README, "Makefile standard"
#
# This file is VENDORED VERBATIM and never edited in place. `make lint` runs
# the drift gate (`standard-check`), which fetches the canonical copy and fails
# on any difference. Per-repo variation is expressed as CONFIGURATION — the
# variables below, set in the repo's own Makefile before `include standard.mk`
# — never as a local edit, because a local edit is the fork this exists to
# prevent.
#
# The contract:
#
#   Makefile                configuration only: feature flags, command
#                           variables, `include standard.mk`, and any target
#                           genuinely local to the repo.
#   standard.mk             the shared targets (this file).
#   local.mk                optional, auto-included; may only ADD targets,
#                           never redefine a standard one.
#   pyproject.toml          WHICH tools, at WHAT versions.
#   uv.lock                 pins them, committed.
#   .pre-commit-config.yaml WHEN a check fires; dispatches to `make -s
#                           lint-<tool>` so it cannot drift from `make format`.
#   bootstrap.toml          system packages, consumed by `install-deps`.
#   .github/workflows       calls `make <target>`; anything else must be
#                           provably environment plumbing.
#
# Two rules keep the whole thing honest, and both are gates rather than
# review, because none of the drift this replaces was decided — it accumulated:
#
#   * `help` is GENERATED. Every active target carries a `## description` on
#     its rule line, and `help-check` fails if one is missing or if `help`
#     would advertise something that does not exist.
#   * `.PHONY` is derived from `STD_TARGETS`, and `ghost-check` fails if a
#     declared target has no recipe behind it — the failure mode where `make
#     wheel` exits 0 having done nothing.
#
# ── Configuration reference ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Feature flags (set to 1 to enable; unset means the group is not defined at
# all, so its targets do not exist and `help` does not list them):
#
#   HAS_C HAS_PYTHON HAS_RUST HAS_DOCS HAS_DOXYGEN HAS_BENCH HAS_COVERAGE
#   HAS_RELEASE HAS_EXAMPLES
#
# A command variable either has a universally correct default (`TEST_RUST_CMD`
# is `cargo test`) or is REQUIRED once its flag is on — see "Required
# configuration" below for why that is a parse-time error rather than a gate.
# Genuinely optional hooks (`DOCS_PREPARE`, `DOCS_CHECK_CMD`,
# `RELEASE_BRANCH_NOTES`) default to empty and simply do nothing.

# ── Preconditions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# GNU make only, 3.81 or newer. `.FEATURES` arrived in 3.81 and exists in no
# BSD make, so its absence is the probe. Checked because the failure otherwise
# surfaces as an inscrutable syntax error hundreds of lines away.
#
# 3.81 specifically, NOT 3.82: that is what macOS still ships as `make`, so a
# probe for anything newer rejects every macOS CI runner. It cost a red matrix
# to learn — `.RECIPEPREFIX` (3.82+) was the first probe here.

# notice that reads like a pass. Armed on vendoring is the only default that
# cannot be silently skipped.

# hunt through the Makefile, the hook config and the workflows.
#
# Corollary: never invoke a linter with `uvx` or a global install. `uvx ruff`
# resolves to whatever released today, which formats differently from the
# pinned ruff and silently rewrites unrelated files.

#
# Not a weakening: `-k` still exits non-zero if any gate failed, so the run
# fails and `ALL PASS` cannot print. Recursion is what buys it; a target-

# ── hook-stage-check ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `hook-dispatch-check` above proves each hook names a real target. It says
# NOTHING about whether the hook is ever reached, and that is the hole that let
# two of doppler's gates run nowhere for months (doppler#737).
#
# The mechanism, which is worth stating because every part of it reads healthy
# on its own:
#
#   * a hook at `stages: [pre-push]` is installed by `pre-commit install` ONLY
#     when the config also declares `default_install_hook_types`. Without it,
#     plain `pre-commit install` writes `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and nothing
#     else, so the pre-push hook has no git hook to fire from;
#   * `make lint` runs pre-commit at the DEFAULT stage, so CI does not reach it
#     either.
#
# Both halves are individually reasonable. Together they produce a hook that is
# configured, dispatches correctly, passes `hook-dispatch-check`, and executes
# on no machine and in no pipeline. Its findings count is zero because it never
# looked -- a dead gate that happens to be green, which is the one failure mode
# nothing downstream can distinguish from success.
#
# THE TRAP, recorded because it cost a wrong plan once: clearing a backlog does
# not revive such a gate. The backlog is why it cannot be switched on; it is
# not why it does not run. A repo that fixes every finding still runs the tool
# nowhere.
#
# Checked STATICALLY, from the config alone, because that is the property that
# survives a fresh clone: CI has no `.git/hooks` to inspect, and a check that
# passes only on a developer machine that happens to have run `make setup` is
# the same class of illusion being fixed.
#
# `manual` is exempt and deliberately so: it means "never run automatically",
# which is a choice rather than an accident. A `manual` hook that no target
# invokes is still dead, but that is not knowable from this file.
