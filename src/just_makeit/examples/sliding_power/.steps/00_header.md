# sliding_power — sliding window signal power estimator

Estimate the instantaneous power of a signal over a rolling window of N samples:

```
P[n] = (1/N) * sum( |x[n-k]|^2  for k in 0..N-1 )
```

Two update strategies are shown:

- **step()** — O(1) recursive: `sum_sq += new² − old²`
- **SIMD recompute** — horizontally sums the delay line with `JM_ADD_F32` /
  `JM_HSUM_F32` from `jm_simd.h`; used for periodic recalibration and as a
  clean demonstration of the `jm_simd.h` macro set.

The generated `.pyi` class docstring is lifted from the `@brief` on
`my_power_power_est_create()` in the sacred header; section 2 replaces the
scaffold's generic one with a real sentence.

## TL;DR — see it work first

```sh
. <(curl -fsSL https://just-buildit.github.io/just-makeit/install.sh)
just-makeit example sliding_power
# sliding_power: PASSED
```

## Prerequisites

```sh
. <(curl -fsSL https://just-buildit.github.io/just-makeit/install.sh)
```

Pass a custom path to keep the venv somewhere persistent:

```sh
. <(curl -fsSL https://just-buildit.github.io/just-makeit/install.sh) -- ~/my-venv
```

Or with `pip`, which installs just-makeit and then builds the toolchain
venv at `/tmp/jm-venv`:

```sh
pip install just-makeit && just-makeit install-deps
source /tmp/jm-venv/bin/activate
```
