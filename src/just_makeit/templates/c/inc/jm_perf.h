/* ── JM_DEFINE_STEPS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stamps out <fn>_steps() — the outer dispatch loop — from three separate
 * concerns:
 *
 *   fn        - name prefix; calls fn##_step() and fn##_step_batch()
 *   state_t   - state struct type
 *   sample_t  - per-sample type  (e.g. float complex)
 *   LENGTH    - history depth: samples held in state->delay[]  [algorithm]
 *   BATCH     - SIMD width in samples                          [parallelism]
 *   CHUNK     - samples per scratch-buffer fill                [tuning]
 *
 * Convention: state->delay[0..LENGTH-1] is the delay line, delay[0] = newest.
 * LENGTH, BATCH, and CHUNK must be integer constant expressions (no VLA).
 *
 * state->delay must exist even for a stateless object (LENGTH=0): whenever a
 * SIMD tier is active (BATCH > 1 — always true on aarch64, since NEON is
 * unconditional there, unlike AVX2/AVX-512 which need explicit compiler
 * flags), the generated steps() references state->delay[...] in a loop that
 * happens to run zero iterations when LENGTH is 0 — the member still has to
 * exist for the translation unit to compile. A single-element placeholder
 * field (e.g. `float delay[1]`) is enough.
 *
 * Usage (16-tap FIR: TAPS=16, LENGTH=TAPS-1=15):
 *   JM_DEFINE_STEPS(fir_filter, fir_filter_state_t, float complex,
 *                   FIR_LENGTH, FIR_BATCH, FIR_CHUNK)
 *
 * Controllable per-call overrides (gh-240): when a state field is
 * `controllable = true`, the generated fn_step() gains a trailing scalar
 * parameter (e.g. `fn_step(state, x, float gain)`) and fn_steps() must accept
 * and forward it. Use JM_DEFINE_STEPS_EX with two paren-wrapped suffixes — the
 * parameter list and the matching argument list — so the macro threads the
 * control into fn_steps()'s signature, the scalar tail call, and the SIMD batch
 * call alike. Your hand-written fn_step_batch() takes the same trailing param:
 *   JM_DEFINE_STEPS_EX(fir_filter, fir_filter_state_t, float complex,
 *                      FIR_LENGTH, FIR_BATCH, FIR_CHUNK,
 *                      (, float gain), (, gain))
 *   //  -> void fir_filter_steps(state, in, out, n, float gain)
 *   //     fir_filter_step(state, in[_i], gain)
 *   //     fir_filter_step_batch(state, _scratch + _p, output + _i + _p, gain)
 * Plain JM_DEFINE_STEPS forwards to EX with empty suffixes (byte-identical to
 * the pre-gh-240 expansion), so non-controllable perf code is unchanged.
 */

/* Strip one layer of parens from a paren-wrapped token so a comma-containing
 * suffix can be passed as a single macro argument: JM_EVAL_IMPL (, float g) yields
 * `, float g`; JM_EVAL_IMPL () yields nothing. */
