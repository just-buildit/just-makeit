# gh-1305: resolve libm to a PATH, not the bare name `m`. A bare `m` in
# `target_link_libraries` is looked up as a CMake TARGET first, so a module
# named `m` (`jm module m`) shadows the system math library: the object's
# test/bench link the module's DSO and fail with `undefined reference to sqrt`,
# and the module's own pair fail configure outright with "Target "m" of type
# MODULE_LIBRARY may not be linked into another target". A `find_library`
# result is an absolute path that no target name can shadow. Empty where libm
# lives in libc (MSVC, and platforms that fold it into libSystem), which links
# nothing.
