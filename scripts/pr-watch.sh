# pr-watch.sh — report what a PR's checks did. It NEVER authorizes a merge.
#
# The merge gate is `gh pr merge --auto`: GitHub evaluates the repo's required
# check set server-side and merges when it is satisfied. That is the real fix
# for everything below — a watcher that decides "looks green, merge it" is
# re-implementing a gate that already exists and cannot be got wrong. Arm
# auto-merge first; use this only to find out whether the PR landed or is
# genuinely stuck, so a failure is noticed rather than waited on forever.
#
# It still has to be careful, because a watcher that lies about the outcome
# sends you looking in the wrong place. Every hand-rolled version of this poll
# fails TOWARD green, silently. Three ways, all hit for real on this repo:
#
#   1. Watching a run id picked by recency. `gh run list -L 1` returns the
#      newest run of ANY workflow on the branch, so it happily reports the
#      docker or artifact workflow finishing while the test matrix is still
#      queued. Anchoring to the PR's head SHA is the fix — a run id is not the
#      thing you care about, the commit's check set is.
#   2. Inferring completion from the ABSENCE of a marker. Right after a
#      force-push GitHub has not created the check runs yet, so `grep pending`
#      finds nothing and the loop exits declaring victory with zero checks run.
#      A trailing blank line does the same to a naive `grep -v pending`.
#   3. Trusting a verdict that predates the push. `gh pr checks --watch` can
#      attach to the PRIOR run after a re-push and render its old conclusions
#      instantly, which looks like a very fast pass.
#
# So: bind to the head SHA, require a non-empty and fully-settled check set,
# and re-anchor if the SHA moves underneath us rather than reporting a result
# for a commit that is no longer the PR.
#
# Advisory checks that must not block a merge are named in ADVISORY (a
# comma-separated list of check names, default `codecov/patch`). They are
# reported but never fatal.
