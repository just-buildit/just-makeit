# CANONICAL. Vendored verbatim by adopters and gated by `make standard-check`;
# per-repo variation is configuration below, never an edit to this file.
#
# Given a version, finds its release.yml run, streams job outcomes, recovers
# from ONE pre-publish flake (rerun a failed job, or cancel+rerun a hung one),
# and verifies the artifacts a consumer actually touches: PyPI (per-version
# endpoint, then `latest`, which lags 30-60s), the GitHub Release (published,
# not a draft, has notes), and optionally release assets.
#
# The recovery is SAFE because release.yml gates the PyPI publish behind the
# wheel smoke test: while the publish has not succeeded, nothing has reached
# PyPI, so a rerun cannot double-publish. Once it succeeds we never rerun — a
# later failure is a real problem for a human, and re-uploading an existing
# version would fail.

# ── 1. Find the release run for the tag (it may lag the push by a few seconds).
#
# Matched on the tag's COMMIT as well as its name. Selecting on the name alone
# is not enough once a tag has been deleted and re-pushed: a run for the
# PREVIOUS push still carries that `headBranch`, so the "wait for the run to
# appear" loop below is satisfied on its first iteration by a run that finished
# hours ago -- and a tag push returns before GitHub has created the new run, so
# the stale one is all there is to find at that moment.
#
# Measured on just-makeit v0.74.0 (2026-09-01): the first attempt failed its
# pre-publish smoke, the tag was deleted, the defect fixed and the tag
# re-pushed. `release-watch` then attached to the FIRST run and reported its
# failure -- twelve red smoke jobs, `publish: skipped` -- while the real run
# was still in progress and went on to publish cleanly. The ordering was never
# wrong; `[0]` is the newest. The existence check was.
#
# That is the failure mode this script's own header already warns about: a
# watcher that can report the wrong run is worse than no watcher, because the
# failure it invents is indistinguishable from a real one and the first
# instinct is to go fix a release that is already fine.
#
# Resolving the SHA from the REMOTE, not a local ref: `release-watch` is a
# separate target from `tag-release` and may be run from a checkout that never

# to the commit it points at -- without it this compares against the tag

# When THAT is what failed, rerunning the RELEASE run is useless: the verify job
# simply re-reads the same completed failure and fails again in under a second,
# burning the one recovery on something that could never have worked. That is

# out in one of six Python jobs, long after every wheel had already built.
#
# The repair has to start one run earlier, on CI itself. `wait_ci` tolerates the

# it re-completes, so "absent" means in-flight, not failed.
